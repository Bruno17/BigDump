# BigDump
Staggered import of large and very large MySQL Dumps (like <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a> dumps) even through the web servers with hard runtime limit and those in safe mode. The script imports only a small part of the huge dump and restarts itself. The next session starts where the last was stopped.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to report any bugs in this release but read the <a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/usage/">usage notes</a> and <a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/faqs/">the FAQs</a> first!
